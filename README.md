A University of Bristol Programming Languages-based dissertation.

Throughout this project, I engaged with the task of translating popular trading card game _Magic: The Gathering_ into DSL form, which was then used in order to test the capabilities of the Entity-Component System design pattern seen in _Thief: The Dark Project_ and _Overwatch (2016)_. 

Currently, this does not serve as a simulator or user-intended product, but instead provides the groundwork and proof for a scalable, updatable and powerful application of ECS to theoretical, decision-based gaming.
